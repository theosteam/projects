# Our Projects

Here’s a list of all the projects we’re working on:

### Active Projects
- **LambdaOS**: 
  [LambdaOS](https://theosteam.github.io/lambdaos) is a custom Linux distribution based on Kubuntu, designed with a focus on aesthetics and user experience. It aims to provide a sleek and modern desktop environment while removing unnecessary bloat. By refining the KDE Plasma desktop and optimizing performance, LambdaOS ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyday use. Its clean interface and efficient resource management make it a great choice for users who want a polished and responsive operating system without the extra fluff.

- **LambdaFetch**: 
  [LambdaFetch](https://github.com/theosteam/lambdafetch) is a fork of Fastfetch, created to replace the default Neofetch in our setup. It offers a streamlined and efficient way to display system information in the terminal. While it started as a replacement for Neofetch, LambdaFetch is designed to be lightweight and customizable, allowing users to easily view essential system details. Currently, development is paused, but the project remains a solid tool for anyone looking to enhance their terminal's visual appeal with concise system info.
